Author: Shreyansh Singh
Internship: ShadowFox
Month: February 2026

📌 Overview

Developed a machine learning regression model to predict Boston house prices.

Utilized socio-economic and housing-related features such as crime rate, number of rooms, tax rate, etc.

Compared multiple regression algorithms to determine the most accurate model.
